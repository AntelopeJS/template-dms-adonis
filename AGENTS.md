# AntelopeJS DMS inside AdonisJS

This AdonisJS application runs the AntelopeJS DMS as an embedded guest runtime:
`antelope.config.ts` is only a placeholder that `ajs project init` keeps instead of
writing its own. `providers/antelope_provider.ts` creates the
runtime with `createRuntime` and lists the modules, which are ordinary npm
dependencies. Host code reaches the DMS through
`runtime.use('<interface package>[/subpath]')`, never by importing an
`@antelopejs/interface-*` package.

The DMS guidance ships as skills inside its packages, synced into the project
once `pnpm install` has run: Claude Code reads them from `.claude/skills/`,
Codex from `.agents/skills/`. When they seem missing:

- Claude Code: run `/antelopejs:sync-skills`; `/antelopejs:skills` lists what
  is synced. The antelopejs plugin syncs on session start and after installs,
  and `.claude/settings.json` offers to install it when you trust this folder.
- Codex: run `npx -y github:AntelopeJS/agent-skills sync --target codex` from
  the project root (`list` instead of `sync` shows what is synced), then
  restart Codex if a skill does not appear.

Start with the `dms` skill for the mental model and its routing, and follow
`dms-best-practices` when building pages and blocks. The DMS skills assume an
`ajs`-driven project when they talk about `antelope.config.ts` and dev servers:
here, configure modules in the provider and run the app with `pnpm dev`. The
dashboard is built and served with `pnpm frontend:build` then
`pnpm frontend:start` while `pnpm dev` runs; `ajs dms dev` does not work in
embedded mode.

## Checks

`pnpm run checks` runs typecheck, lint, format, knip, `pnpm test`, size,
suppressions and sync, and prints only what failed.

- `pnpm test` boots the whole application, so it needs MongoDB on
  `mongodb://localhost:27017`. It reads `.env.test` (`NODE_ENV=test`) and
  falls back to `.env` for keys `.env.test` lacks. CI has no `.env` while it
  runs the tests, so add every new key of `start/env.ts` to `.env.example` and
  `.env.test`.
- `checks` does not build or start the app. CI runs `pnpm build`, then boots
  `node ace serve` and queries `/dms/info` and the DMS API: see
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Neither checks the dashboard
  (`pnpm frontend:build`).
- `guardrails.suppressions.json` caps the lint directives, `@ts-expect-error`,
  `@ts-ignore` and `SAFETY:` comments; its numbers only go down. After you
  remove suppressions, run `pnpm run suppressions:update` and commit the
  lowered file. `pnpm run checks` fails when a count rises above its ceiling.
- The code style is AdonisJS's (no semicolons, single quotes, 100 columns), set
  in `oxfmt.config.ts`. `oxlint.config.ts` carries the `@adonisjs/eslint-config`
  rules oxlint has. `node ace make:*` output still needs `pnpm format`; delete
  the commented `HttpContext` import of a generated controller and give a
  generated test an assertion before you commit.

## Guardrails

Lint with `oxlint` and format with `oxfmt`; both read the configs at the repository root. Fix every finding: no rule warns.

Prove a change works with the verification skill in [`.agents/skills/verify-template/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/verify-template/SKILL.md) before you call it done.

### Comments

Say it in code. A constraint belongs in a type, a lint rule, or a test. A public item's contract belongs in TSDoc (`/** */`) on that item. The only other comments are lint directives that name their rules, `@ts-expect-error <reason>`, `SAFETY: <reason>` above a type assertion, `/*!` license headers, and bundler or formatter directives.

Before suppressing a type rule, try inference or a type derived from its owner with `Parameters`, `ReturnType`, or indexed access. A private alias can still appear in a published declaration. Keep a suppression only after checking the published contract and the unchecked boundary it protects.

Check each directive reason against the current line and its callers. Returning a value is not the same as awaiting and discarding it. A reason must describe what the code does now.

### Tests

Hold every test you write or keep to this checklist:

- Name the wrong implementation this test fails on. A test with no answer is deleted, not kept.
- No test reads the file it tests. Drive the behaviour through the public interface.
- An invariant over many files is a lint rule, not a test.

### Cleanup proof

A behaviour-preserving cleanup PR shows `antelopejs-api-diff <base-ref>` passing. Published declarations, built runtime exports and the names and signatures a DMS frontend module auto-imports stay unchanged; pass `--allow-added <glob>` (repeatable, e.g. `'**/internal/**'`) to let added entries under that glob pass when their module is `@internal`, and copy its "Added (allowed)" list. Every export under a directory that `dms.frontend.build.ts` auto-imports is published, `@internal` or not; a helper that must stay private goes under `app/build/`. A comment-only PR shows `antelopejs-comment-proof <base-ref>` passing instead of a verifier. Both compare committed HEAD.

Copy the proof's whole output into the PR body, down to its closing `<!-- antelopejs-proof ... -->` line, which stamps the command, base, committed head and a digest. Never type counts by hand. List the lint findings a PR leaves in place by pasting the block `antelopejs-body-check --findings` prints and replacing each `<why>`. `antelopejs-body-check <body.md>` fails an edited or stale proof block, proof output outside one, and a findings line that is not a live diagnostic at HEAD; counts in prose are not checked, so leave them out. The table counts a lint directive once per rule it names, inline directives included.

Pass `--probe <file.cjs>` to api-diff when changing receivers, positional calls, or modules that no published entry reaches. The same captured script runs against both worktree roots, supplied as `argv[2]`, and prints JSON observations. Matching metadata alone does not prove those behaviours.

An entry-only rule exempts only its own module. Add a second module entry rather than exempting another importer. A no-upward rule must reject peers in the same tier as well as higher tiers. Probe the rank decision with an import, not just a reading of the configuration.

Moving a method body into a function keeps how it is called: the same receiver, argument count, read order and laziness.

Verify a boundary against the imports a developer or agent would plausibly write: static and dynamic imports, re-exports, Vue `src`, CSS `@import`, and worker or child-process entries in normally named files. A construction only an evasion would write, an edit to resolution configuration (`package.json` `browser`, `exports`, `main` or `imports`, bundler aliases, tsconfig `paths`), and a difference observable only by patching private fields or internal methods go under Attention and never block. Public API and ordinary subclass behaviour stay part of the contract.
